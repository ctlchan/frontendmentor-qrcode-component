## Overview

## My process
First and foremost, I took a look at the provided design in order to get a sense of the structure. This not only helps me determine what HTML tags
to use, but also how I should organize divs and classes, in order to apply my CSS styling.

I then created index.html and defined all the tags I needed. Finally, all that was left was to style it. I started broadly, and worked my way
"into" the HTML.

### Built with
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this mini-challenge, I gained exposure with front-end mentor, as well as practice with CSS and in particular, Flexbox.

### Continued development

I want to get more practice with CSS. I want to improve in all manners, from general design sense and implementation, to specific tricks.
I had just learned Flexbox and this was my first experience applying it. I ran into some issues, so I also look to utilize it more in the future.
